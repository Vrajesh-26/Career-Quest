For example, if you have two files—version1.txt and version2.txt—you can use the command fc version1.txt version2.txt to see what's different between them. This is helpful for developers, writers, or system admins who want to track changes in code, documentation, or settings. You can also compare binary files with the /B switch, which shows differences in hexadecimal. Overall, FC is a lightweight but powerful tool for quick file comparisons directly from the command line
